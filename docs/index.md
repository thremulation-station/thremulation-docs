<hr />
<br>
Thremulation Station is an approachable small-scale threat emulation and detection range. It leans on Atomic Red Team for ***emulating*** threats, and the Elastic Endpoint Agent for ***detection***.

!!! info "TL;DR"
    If you're ready to skip the reading and jump into things, head to the [Quickstart / Installation](/quickstart/installation.md) section.

There are a lot of tools and moving pieces, but the main building blocks are:

- Virtualbox
- Vagrant
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- Elastic Endpoint Agent
- Atomic Red Team
- Caldera


## Project Goals

Our goal from the very beginning has been to provide the following:

1. lightweight range that can operate on a laptop with a _minimum_ of 4 threads and 8G of RAM
1. support the big 3 host operating systems (initial linux path is RHEL-based)
1. present users a smooth path to execute threats and observe them with Elastic 
1. provide a singular TUI (Station Control) that can be used to manage all aspects

!!! note "Note"
    You'll be introduced to `./stationctl` early in the [Getting Started](/getting-started/deployment/#introduction-to-station-control) section and use it to deploy boxes, get status, manage and clear data, and much more. A full reference guide is located at [support / stationctl](/support/stationctl.md).
