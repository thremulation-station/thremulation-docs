## The Problem to Solve

Not everyone has a blade server heating their home from a closet... and not everyone has the time or engineering skills that can stitch  complex systems together to create an environment to sharpen their skills. Whether you're just getting started, a junior analyst, or a weathered and pale operator with years hunting experience.


## Use Cases

This project has many practical use cases, and we're excited to see how it's used. A few examples:

- Cyber Defense education
- Generating training data
- Threat intelligence training
- Writing and validating [detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules)
- Writing and testing threat [tactics and techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/)


## Workflow

Let's look at an overview of the mini-range and demonstrate a basic exercise workflow.

1. Access the `ts.elastomic` control box interfaces
1. Choose your target host (currently windows10 or centos)
2. Launch either a prebuilt threat tactic / technique or your own custom
3. Victim machines report back to `ts.elastomic` where artificacts can be observed
