Station Control Intro Thremulation Station comes with a terminal control interface called stationctl . It is used to perform most major tasks within the environment. An overview of some of the tasks provided are: configure and deploy a range check the status of a current range management tasks on a current range reloading / rebuilding boxes data reset (clearing indexes) various troubleshooting steps Warning stationctl is a script located in the vagrant directory, and must be executed from <project>/vagrant ! Launching the CLI Let's start up stationctl for the first time to prepare to deploy. Ensure that you're in the project's vagrant directory, example: ~/code/thremulation-station/vagrant Execute the Station Control script: $ ./stationctl To enter the \"Deployment\" menu select option # 2 Note: To exit the CLI you can enter E to exit, or less gracefully, ctrl + c at any time Deployment A \"deployment\" consists of selecting the nodes (VMs) you want, downloading them, and turning them all on in sequence. There are 3 distinct types of deployments to choose from in the CLI: Quick - give me all the things Custom - choose the just the boxes you want Staged - more a download than a deployment for later Quick Deployment A Quick Deployment is the first and fastest option. It enables all VMs included in the range, meaning the control machine, a Windows10 workstation, and a Linux server. Select option # 1 and then Y to confirm that you want to depoy this configuration and kick things off. So what's happening here? This deployment will download, turn on, and configure (provision) all 3 boxes in the order displayed. Get yourself some fresh coffee, this will take 15-30 minutes, depending on your particular bandwidth available. Please note, if you're on a Windows10 host system, you will need to allow \"Allow Connections\" in the windows firewall for private connections. Attention! This is a bandwidth-intensive task that will take a while. But take heart, this is the one tax you'll have to pay, and it happens up front (and only the first time you deploy). Get some coffee, and drink you cup slowly, savoring these infrequently quiet moments. Also Note: If you don't drink coffee, I don't trust you and I'm not sure I want you having any part of this. Custom Deployment A custom deployment works generally the same way as quick one, but provides you the option to choose what target VMs to deploy alongside the control (ts.elastomic) box. Example: A great usecase for this would be if you're very limited on hardware resources, and you only intend on emulating and detecting threats against a linux server. You have the flexibility to say (N)o to Windows and (Y)es to Linux, which would look like so: Staged Deployment The staged deployment selection process works similarly to the others, but only pulls (donwloads) the boxes you select for later playtime.

From your terminal run $ vagrant ssh ts.elastomic to establish as shell session on the combo logger / attacker box. Your prompt will update to indicate you're connected to the elastomic box. Then, enter pwsh to drop into a Powershell session. Now it is time to choose what test or attack you would like to run against the remote Windows 10 box. You'll see your prompt change to PS /home/vagrant> . You can browse the available tests by referencing the Atomic Redteam Docs . For this demonstration we will conduct a simple example technique and test. It will use Powershell to download Mimikatz and then dump credentials on the system. More info about this specific technique and test can be found here: T1059.001 TestNumber 1 Before we can run this test against the Windows 10 box we first need to setup a Powershell Session over SSH to the Windows 10 box. Create a necessary variable by running the below command. Enter \"yes\" and the password vagrant if prompted: $sess = New-PSSession -Hostname 192 . 168 . 33 . 11 -Username vagrant Info What does this do? We are creating a variable called $sess and setting it's value to our new session we just created using the New-PSSession Powershell cmdlet.

You should see results filtered to show the events matching the Mimikatz attack you just executed. Tip Your simple KQL query for \"Mimikatz\" is case-insensitive, but ensure that your timepicker is set to something sensible like \"Today\" or \"Last 15 minutes\". Kibana is (rightfully) very picky about time. Reset Button Clean logs -- clean mind right? While the data in Kibana is separated by the fact that it's time-series data, it can be helpful to clear previous attacks and leftover artifacts, especially in an education setting. Let's talk about how to hit the reset button. Target Systems Info The term \"target systems\" refers to the ts.windows10 and ts.centos7 boxes. Most of (if not all) Atomic Red Team tests come with a cleanup command to clear your target system before executing another test. In order to cleanup our Mimikatz test we can run the same command we used to execute it this time with a -Cleanup option at the end. Run the following command to clean house: Invoke-AtomicTest T1059 . 001 -TestNumbers 1 -Session $sess -Cleanup Attacker / Logger System The \"control\" node that is used to perform all attacking and logging operations is the ts.elatomic box. We can use the stationctl CLI to perform a data reset. This will clear all existing Elasticsearch index data to wipe the slate clean. Station control should be executed from the vagrant/ folder, so ensure that you're in the right folder: <THIS-PROJECT-REPO>/vagrant/ . You can perform a \"Clear Data\" operation with the following commands: Start CLI: $ ./stationctl Enter option #4: Management: tune and troubleshoot Enter option #6: Clear Data: delete data in all indexes Next Steps Now that we've passed the functions check and you're able to dig into all of the events, you can jump right into building detections based off of the logs produced using Thremulation Station. You can then run the test again to verify your detection logic is sound.

The premise of red teaming is comparable to the old sports saying, \"the best offense is a good defense.\" Red teaming helps defenders learn about new adversary techniques. To provide threat emulation, we have used Red Canary's open source project, Atomic Red Team and MITRE's CALDERA project. Atomic Red Atomic Red Team is a library of simple tests that every security team can execute to test their defenses. Tests are focused, have few dependencies, and are defined in a structured format that can be used by automation frameworks.

Threat Logging & Detection Threat detection (or blue teaming) is the process of defending assets and infrastructure from adversaries. This is achieved through a combination of signature-based detections and also access to all available log data to find activity that does not trigger any known signatures. To provide logging and detection, we are using the Elastic Stack - Elasticsearch , Kibana , Beats , and Agents .

View and create adversary profiles Create and run an operation Hunt for operation activity in Kibana Pre-Reqs Let's get set up for this lab: Vagrant up the elastomic and windows10 box: vagrant up ts.elastomic ts.windows10 Establish an RDP session with the windows10 box with the RDPclient of your choice, with the following data: host:192.168.33.11 user:vagrant pass:vagrant Startup Caldera comes pre-installed on the elastomic host, and is located in the /home/vagrant directory. In order to utilize it you only need to start up the Caldera server, so let\u2019s do that. First ssh into the elastomic box with the following command: vagrant ssh ts.elastomic Once you are ssh\u2019d into elastomic, move into the Caldera directory: cd caldera Start up the Caldera server by running: python3 server.py \u2014 insecure The server startup will take at most 30 seconds, after which we can validate by pointing your local browser to http://localhost:8888 . You should see the following: Interface Now that we have our server running hosted locally, we can login and take a look around Default credentials for your Caldera server are: admin:admin After successfully logging in you should see the Caldera welcome page Click on the hamburger menu next to navigate in the top left corner to dis play the different options Caldera provides The primary menu options you will be concerned with are the Agents, Adversaries, and Operations sections. Agents We will start with the agents tab, so go ahead and click it This tab allows us to configure, create, and deploy an agent on one of our \u201cvictim\u201d boxes that will communicate back to our Caldera server where we can run our operations from. Before we create our agent, lets explore some of the up front configuration options we have available Beacon Timer Beacon timer allows you to specify how long your agent will wait to check in and send back data. By default, these values are set to 30 and 60 which is fine. You may want to change these if you are emulating a specific adversary, or just trying to remain undetected from any hunting the defender may be doing. Watchdog Timer Watchdog timer lets you set the number of seconds to wait once the server is unreachable, before killing an agent. Untrusted Timer Untrusted timer sets the number of seconds to wait before marking a missing agent as untrusted. Implant Name The base name of newly-spawned agents. If necessary, an extension will be added when an agent is created e.g splunkd will become splunkd.exe when spawning an agent on a Windows machine. Bootstrap Ability Bootstrap ability is a comma-separated list of ability IDs to be run on a new agent beacon. By default, this is set to run a command which clears command history. Now that we understand the available configuration options, lets go ahead and generate a new agent for us to deploy to our windows10 box We are going to use the default values for this test, so go ahead and choose \u201cclick here to deploy an agent\u201d button and you will see the following option If you click the dropdown for \u201cChoose an agent\u201d you will see anumber of options Each of these agents provide a brief description The only two I have tested are \"54ndc47\" and \"Manxagents\" For general purposes, use the 54ndc47 agent as it was developed directly for use with Caldera Choose the 54ndc47 agent and select the \u201cAllplatforms\u201d dropdown to choose your OS For this lab, we will choose windows for our windows10 host For the app.contact.http field, you will supply the ip or url of your Caldera server: 192.168.33.10:8888 Caldera generates a Powershell command to download and execute the Caldera GoLang agent on your windows10 host Copy that command in full and lets go over to our windows10 RDP session Open a Powershell prompt as administrator Now, paste yourCaldera agent Powershell one-liner and hit enter to download and execute the agent Once this is done, we can go back to our Caldera server GUI Click the \"x\" in the top right corner of the agent selection box you were in, and you should now see an agent has checked into the Caldera server Before we move on to emulating adversary activity, let's explore some of the information the agent provides us As you can see if gives a uniqueagent id, the host, protocol, agent, process id, and if the agent is running in a privileged context or not.

Below the generic information, you can see what platform it is compatible with and what is being utilized to execute this technique Scroll down further and you will see the command that is being executed, along with a cleanup command and timeout value Now, click the \"x\" in the top right corner of the screen and we will create our own profile to execute on our \u201cvictim\u201d Under profiles, change the slider from \"view\" to \"add\" I\u2019m going to use the profile name of \"Test\" but you can use whatever name you like Next, I will fill out a clear description e.g. \u201ca set of TTPs for displaying Caldera\u2019s functionality\u201d Let's add some abilities to our profile Click the +add ability selector on the right side of your screen, which will pop up a familiar menu Let's select a TTP: discovery tactic, T1007 System Service Discovery, and Discover System Services ability If you scroll down, you will see the command being run is the Powershell cmdlet Get-Service executed by Powershell as evidenced by the psh executor Click the green add to adversary button in the bottom left of the screen to add this TTP to our profile You can see we now have added this TTP as the first step in our attack I\u2019ve added a second attack ability -- you can add as many as you wish, but for my purposes here this will be fine Save this profile and move on to executing it with our agent on the windows10 box Once saved, you will see \"Adversary Saved\"! Operations Scroll up and click the hamburger menu in the top left of the Caldera interface, and select the Operations tab to display the following screen: There are currently no operations created, so clicking the\u201cOperations\u201d dropdown will not display anything... so let's create our own operation Click the slider to change it from view to add This allows you to specify a number of options in order to configure your operation successfully I will name it \"Operation Test\" Click Basic Options and we'll cover what this provides: The first dropdown sets your group and by default all agents are added to the \u201cred\u201d group which is what I have selected The second dropdown sets the profile you would like this operation to run. I have selected the Test profile I created earlier The third dropdown sets the option to close this operation orleave it open for future execution. I have set this to auto close since this is a lab The last dropdown sets the operation to run immediately after starting, or pausing for you to inspect it. I have set it run immediately Click Basic Options to close it and click Autonomous The first dropdown sets the operation to run autonomously or manually with approval of each TTP executed The second dropdown sets which planner you will utilize to execute the operation. A planner is a module within CALDERA which contains logic for how a running operation should make decisions about abilities to use and in what order The final dropdown sets the facts you will use during the operation. A fact is an identifiable piece of information about a given computer. Facts are directly related to variables, which can be used inside abilities Now click \"Autonomous\" to close it and click on \"Stealth\" The only dropdown here allows for you to select a number of obfuscation techniques to obscure the commands you run on the host system The second field sets the jittervalue. Agents normally check in with CALDERA every 60 seconds. Once they realize they are part of an active operation, agents will start checking in according to the jitter time, which is by default 2/8. This fraction tells the agents that they should pause between 2 and 8 seconds (picked at random each time an agent checks in) before using the next ability The visibility slider lets you set how stealthy your operation will remain. How visible should the operation be to the defense. This defaults to 51 because each ability defaults to a visibility of 50. Abilities with a higher visibility than the operation visibility will be skipped Click Stealth to close it Don\u2019t click Schedule. Schedule allows for scheduling this operation for a later time, which we will not be doing in this lab Now click start to begin you roperation and select include agent output There is a lot here, but much of it is self-explanatory The first option to note is the ability at the top of the screen to stop, pause, play, and skip the operation Another option is the ability at any time to switch your operation from an autonomous to a manual one Now we can see that our Discover System Services ability was executed on the host and since we enabled the inclusion of agent output if we can click the star at the end of the ability line we should be able to see the output from the command Click the x in the top right corner to return to the operation screen Congratulations!! You have successfully deployed an agent, created an adversary profile, created an operation and run that profile against a host. Now, let's cleanup up the range environment Clean Up Normally you might want to save all operations and profiles you create, but in this instance we'll get rid of them so you can start fresh First, we will delete this operation. Go ahead and click the green delete button located under download report which will revert your screen back to the original operations screen Next, click the x in the top left corner of the operations tab to remove it from your interface You should now be on the profiles tab which you can do the same thing in. Click the green delete profile button, click ok and then the red x in the top left hand corner For the final piece, lets kill our agent and remove it from the agents tab Click the green agent PID and select kill agent then select ok Wait for the agent PID to turn red or refresh the Caldera browser tab and go back to the agents tab. This may take a minute or two depending on the agents configuration Once the agent shows as terminated, click the red x at the end of it to remove it from your view and you are all cleaned up....aside from one thing. The windows box. If you want to ensure a clean windows box you can use the stationctl management menu to perform a soft reset and revert the windows box back to a clean instance taken upon deployment Thrunting Now lets switch over to our Kibana session and go to the Discover tab. Select the logs-* index The best way to view the activity we conducted on our host is to filter down the data to just want we want to see in this case I want to see process creation events and I want to display the user, parent process name, executing process name and command line. Since the agent we used was named \"Splunkd\", filtering down the wanted activity will be easy. Let's walk through what's been done here: I've filtered the data set using the winlog channel field which contains the different event subscriptions we have available to us. Since we want a specific windows event ID, I chose the Security channel. I then wanted to specify the process creation event id of 4688, which I did by utilizing the event.code field. Lastly, I knew the name of my implant was Splunkd so I filtered on the parent process name field to specify the Splunkd process name To view the specific fields I wanted to see, I can simply search for the field names on the left hand side and added them to my table As you can see, we have this Splunkd.exe spawning Powershell.exe as the user vagrant on the windows10 host to run the Get-Service command There are a number of different detections we could write for this, but that is a lab for another day.
